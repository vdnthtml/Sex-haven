# Helixar Infrastructure Monitoring Checklist

## Weekly Monitoring Routine

### 1. Vercel Usage Monitoring
**Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
**Check Frequency**: Weekly
**Free Tier Limits**:
- Build minutes: 6,000 minutes/month
- Serverless function invocations: 100,000/month
- Bandwidth: 100GB/month

**What to Monitor**:
- [ ] Build minutes used vs. limit
- [ ] Function invocations (especially `/api/analyze`)
- [ ] Bandwidth usage
- [ ] Build failures or errors
- [ ] Deployment success rate

**Action Items**:
- If approaching 80% of limits, optimize builds
- Consider upgrading to Pro plan only if consistently hitting limits
- Monitor for unusual spikes in usage

### 2. Firebase Usage Monitoring
**Dashboard**: https://console.firebase.google.com
**Check Frequency**: Weekly
**Free Tier Limits**:
- Firestore: 1GB storage, 50,000 reads/day, 20,000 writes/day
- Authentication: 10,000 authentications/month
- Storage: 5GB storage, 1GB downloads/day

**What to Monitor**:
- [ ] Firestore document reads/writes
- [ ] Authentication requests
- [ ] Storage usage
- [ ] Real-time database connections
- [ ] Function invocations (if using Cloud Functions)

**Action Items**:
- Set up Firebase Alerts for budget thresholds
- Monitor for unusual authentication patterns
- Check for data growth trends

### 3. Gemini API Usage Monitoring
**Dashboard**: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
**Check Frequency**: Daily (CRITICAL)
**Free Tier Limits**:
- 15 requests per minute
- 1,500 requests per day

**What to Monitor**:
- [ ] Daily request count
- [ ] Request success/failure rate
- [ ] Response times
- [ ] Error rates
- [ ] Cost per request

**Action Items**:
- **MOST CRITICAL**: Ensure no background processes calling API
- Monitor for unusual usage patterns
- Set up alerts for approaching limits
- Consider batching or optimization if needed

### 4. Google Analytics Usage
**Dashboard**: https://analytics.google.com
**Check Frequency**: Weekly
**Free Tier Limits**:
- 10 million hits per month
- Standard reports and features

**What to Monitor**:
- [ ] Page views
- [ ] Event counts
- [ ] User sessions
- [ ] Conversion rates
- [ ] Performance metrics

**Action Items**:
- Ensure only high-value events are tracked
- Monitor for data quality issues
- Check for unusual traffic patterns

## Monthly Review Checklist

### Performance Review
- [ ] Core Web Vitals scores
- [ ] Page load times
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] User experience metrics

### Cost Analysis
- [ ] Total monthly costs across all services
- [ ] Cost per user
- [ ] Cost per analysis
- [ ] ROI analysis

### Scaling Decisions
- [ ] Evaluate if free tier limits are sufficient
- [ ] Plan for paid tier upgrades if needed
- [ ] Optimize current usage patterns
- [ ] Consider alternative cost-effective solutions

## Alert Setup Instructions

### Firebase Alerts
1. Go to Firebase Console > Project Settings > Usage and billing
2. Set up budget alerts at 80% of free tier limits
3. Configure email notifications

### Vercel Alerts
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard > Settings > Notifications
2. Enable build failure notifications
3. Set up usage alerts

### Manual Monitoring
Since automated alerts may incur costs, maintain manual monitoring:
- Set calendar reminders for weekly checks
- Create a shared spreadsheet for tracking metrics
- Document any unusual patterns or issues

## Emergency Procedures

### If Approaching Limits
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Pause non-essential features
   - Optimize existing code
   - Review for unnecessary API calls

2. **Short-term Solutions**:
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add caching layers
   - Optimize database queries

3. **Long-term Planning**:
   - Evaluate paid tier costs vs. revenue
   - Consider alternative providers
   - Implement usage-based pricing

### If Service Outages
1. Check service status pages
2. Implement fallback mechanisms
3. Communicate with users
4. Document incident for future prevention

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Development Phase
- Use development-only logging
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Test with minimal data sets

### Production Phase
- Implement proper caching
- Use CDN for static assets
- Optimize bundle sizes
- Monitor and remove unused dependencies

### API Usage
- Batch requests where possible
- Implement request deduplication
- Use appropriate API models (cheaper vs. more capable)
- Cache responses when appropriate

## Documentation Requirements

### Weekly Reports
- Usage metrics summary
- Any alerts or issues
- Cost trends
- Performance metrics

### Monthly Reviews
- Comprehensive cost analysis
- Scaling recommendations
- Infrastructure improvements
- Budget planning

### Incident Reports
- Root cause analysis
- Impact assessment
- Prevention measures
- Cost implications
